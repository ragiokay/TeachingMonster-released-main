        1) Extract the main **Course Topic** from the Requirement.

        2) Output a **Design Manifesto** and **Learning Objectives** that align perfectly with the user's Requirement.
        - The manifesto MUST explicitly state that the course structure must follow the provided Requirement.
        - Scope and depth MUST be decided based on the persona: what to emphasize, what to cover lightly, and what not to teach deeply (with brief rationale).

        Lecture-first / low-interaction constraint:
        - Assume this is primarily a lecture-based, information-delivery course (e.g., online learning resources).
        - Avoid relying on interactive, in-person, or high-touch assignments (e.g., group work, live facilitation, workshops).
        - If practice is necessary, prefer low-interaction formats: optional self-check questions, reflection prompts, templates, checklists, worked examples, or lightweight quizzes.

        Planning-only constraint:
        - Do NOT write detailed lesson content, step-by-step teaching scripts, or long examples.
        - Provide teaching direction and intent only.

        Required Output Format (use exact headings):

        A) Course Topic
        - (1 concise sentence)

        B) Persona Scoping Analysis
        - Baseline & prior knowledge assumptions
        - Goals & success definition (persona-specific)
        - Constraints (time/tools/language/context)
        - Depth decisions (Teach / Teach lightly / Not deep) + brief rationale

        C) Design Manifesto
        - Bullet points that define the course design principles.
        - Must include: “This course structure must follow the provided Requirement.”
        - Must reflect lecture-first, low-interaction delivery.

        D) Learning Objectives
        - Each objective: “By the end, the learner can…”
        - Include a mix of essential and optional objectives, with persona-based depth decisions (Core vs Optional vs De-emphasize).

            STRICT OUTPUT RULES
            - Do not output any conversational filler. Start immediately with the course title.
            - Output clean Markdown only.

            DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (Storyboard Execution)
            - Design an execution blueprint that bridges the gap between the provided conceptual inputs (Course Topic, Design Manifesto, Learning Objectives, Persona Scoping Analysis) and the final slide deck.
            - Substance over Outline: Provide concrete derivation steps, core arguments, and rigorous domain knowledge. Do not just list topics like a menu; serve the "main course."
            - Pedagogical Pacing: Deliberately dismantle large, complex concepts into logical sequences spanning 3 to 5 slides to optimize information density and learner comprehension.
            - Visual & Layout Directives: Explicitly map out the specific visual elements and spatial arrangements required for each knowledge point.

            COURSE LENGTH (STRICT HARD LIMIT — do not exceed)
            - MAXIMUM 2 modules/sequences total.
            - Each module uses AT MOST 3 slides (including the mandatory Opening and Conclusion slides which count toward the total).
            - TOTAL SLIDE COUNT MUST NOT EXCEED 6. Consolidate aggressively.
            - Keep the structure minimal-but-sufficient to achieve only the CORE Learning Objectives.

            ## 1. Executive Summary
            - Storyboard purpose and audience fit (tie to persona scoping)
            - Outcomes summary (tie to learning objectives)
            - Execution strategy statement (highlighting substance, pacing, and visual translation)

            ## 2. Pedagogical & Visual Foundations
            - 3–6 concise bullets: specific pacing strategy + visual design rationale
            - Must be consistent with Design Manifesto (do not add conflicting principles)

            ## 3. Storyboard Sequence Overview (Table)
            Provide a Markdown table with columns:
            - Sequence #
            - Sequence title
            - Primary objectives (reference objective numbers)
            - Slide count estimate (e.g., 3-5 slides)
            - Primary visual theme / core layout approach

            ## 4. Detailed Sequence Breakdown (Deep dive)
            For each sequence/module, include:
            - Sequence title
            - Why it exists (maps to persona needs + requirement)
            - Substance & Core Arguments: Concrete domain knowledge, derivations, and actual teaching content (no vague summaries).
            - Pedagogical Pacing (Slide-by-Slide Arc): Explicitly outline the logic step-by-step across 3-5 distinct slides.
            - Visual & Layout Directives: Specify required spatial arrangements, diagrams, and text-to-visual ratios for these slides.
            - Included elements: Specify what content belongs in "Speaker Notes" vs. "On-Screen Visuals".
            - What we intentionally do NOT visualize or expand on (1–3 bullets) + brief reason.

            ## 5. Common Misconceptions & Visual Correction Logic
            - List likely learner misconceptions (persona-informed)
            - For each: misconception → visual/pedagogical correction principle → how the storyboard specifically addresses it (sequence reference)

            ## 6. Conclusion
            - Narrative progression recap
            - Handoff instructions for the final slide design / production phase

            Quality Guardrails
            - Ensure every sequence maps to at least one Learning Objective.
            - The output MUST contain actionable substance, not just placeholder outlines.
            - Maintain an authoritative tone; concise, high-density writing.
